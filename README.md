# Machine learning for disaster: Titanic.
Every aspiring data analyst/data scientist knows about the Titanic dataset that can be found in Kaggle. As someone who wants to go deeper in the data analysis/science field, and like many others, I also think it is a great starting point to start playing around with machine learning. So, this is my attempt of predicting the survival status of Titanic's passengers.<br><br>
With this approach, I manage to get a score of 0.79425 on Kaggle.
